<p>The first wireless function to consider is the security system and its parts, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box. This suggested every windows and door required its own wire and path of holes through your house. Wireless systems use radio frequencies that are just reliable approximately a certain radius.
