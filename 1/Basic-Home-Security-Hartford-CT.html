<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
