Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to keep and how long you plan to keep taped video footage. The video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution.
