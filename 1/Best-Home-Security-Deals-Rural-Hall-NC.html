<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems planned to summon police department workers, requires registration, assessment of charges for excessive incorrect burglar alarms, provides treatments for repeat culprits, and supplies an effective date. While some vestiges of the old market remain, today's property owners are presented with a lot more choices.
