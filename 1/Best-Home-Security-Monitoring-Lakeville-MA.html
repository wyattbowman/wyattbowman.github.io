Salt Lake City needs verification from a private guard. Numerous cities likewise need a permit to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
