<p>The loudest of the smart alarm we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at cautioning anyone in your house and those nearby that there's an issue. Throughout testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we enjoy that the sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adjusted to account for animals, too. The alarm is simply one of 2 we evaluated that includes an external siren, and we're amazed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more discouraging anybody from trying to break in to your property. We evaluated Somfy's more expensive system, which included a wifi security camera, but more budget-friendly kits are likewise offered. Regardless of the hefty price here, there's no external monitoring option.</p>
