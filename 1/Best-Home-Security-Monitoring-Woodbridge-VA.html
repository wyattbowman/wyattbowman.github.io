The Ring Floodlight Camera combines 2 vital gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera discovers movement, it switches on its two effective LED beams in addition to its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Webcam likewise has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their responses.
