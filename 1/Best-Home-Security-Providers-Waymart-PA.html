<p>In the evening, though it lacks the complete IR LED range of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not only is the Arlo fast to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's looking at.
