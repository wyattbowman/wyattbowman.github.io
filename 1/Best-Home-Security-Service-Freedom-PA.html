<p>We required guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to secure the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating system at 5am. The first guard arrived early so he could take a look at the whole location and talk with me about my concerns. He was professional, polite and extremely comforting. The 2nd guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the early morning to get the event started, he was also professional, reassuring and polite. We were extremely delighted with your service and I will advise that we call on your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. As soon as after leaving our residential or commercial property in your hands, I didn't stress.</p>
