<p>Discover how to develop, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and decrease criminal activity. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image.

We are validating with Arlo whether our system was defective, therefore we may review this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud.
