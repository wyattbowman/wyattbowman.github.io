The researchers searched for CCTV examinations released between 2007 and 2017 to account for the period because the last review (which covered assessments completed in 2006 and earlier). Methods consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and contacting leading scientists to inquire about forthcoming examinations.

Larger systems that offer full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most costly choices. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most economical option.</p>
