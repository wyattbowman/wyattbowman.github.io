<p>The first (and most apparent, for sure) component of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends on your private needs and budget; are you positioning them indoors or outdoors? Is 1080P a big adequate resolution? Will they have the ability to see and record video efficiently in low-lighting? Are they positioned with adequate field of vision, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be needed?
