Nevertheless, an exception can be made for home security systems that include benefits like the ADT Mover's Savings Package, which permit you to take your equipment to a new home. This also depends on the provider, however you can anticipate signing a contract with suppliers who need professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some agreements could cover up to 60 months or 5 years.
