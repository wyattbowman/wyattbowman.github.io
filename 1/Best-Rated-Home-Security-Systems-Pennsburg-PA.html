ADT does not have the greatest client service reputation amongst the companies we considered, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this approximately the fact that ADT has a number of million more consumers than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
<p>ADT's monitoring centers supply protection with the latest technological equipment 24 hr a day, 365 days a year. ADT engineers test the company's cameras, entrance contacts, high-decibel alarms, and smoke detector under tough conditions-including extreme cold and heat, as well as scenarios where there might be radio interference.
