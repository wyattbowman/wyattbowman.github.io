Outdoor cameras should be weather resistant and in some cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance rating are the most long lasting. Because their style permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices. In regards to detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will provide more accurate and less frequent alerts because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
<p>Geofencing: This function automates motion detection when you return or leave to a predetermined location (normally your home). In this manner, you don't have to remember to shut off the camera's monitoring functions each time you get home.

Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a bigger area such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>
<p>Some home insurance providers require you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. Nevertheless, alarms needed by insurance companies should comply with the European Standard EN 50131 and must be set up by an NSI or SSAIB accredited installer.

With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to get sensing units required to control your equipment including allowing, disabling and sending you immediate signals.
