Outdoor cameras should be weather resistant and in some cases, completely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most resilient. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices since their design permits minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection instead of motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will provide more precise and less regular signals.</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance.

A wireless bridge is a fantastic option for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>
