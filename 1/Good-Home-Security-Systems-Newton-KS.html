<p>Several screens were set up within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm displays.

If there are three select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single set camera can just view one. This produces a one in 3 opportunity of capturing a particular incident on video (either live or recorded). The command center also included a computer designated for filing incident reports online. These can be accessed by management personnel at a later date from a database via the computer system network.</p>

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
