Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by.
