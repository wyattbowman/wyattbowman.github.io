<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to fix information after the truth, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of recording storage area. A lot, in reality, that they require about 4 times the disk drive area of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage.
