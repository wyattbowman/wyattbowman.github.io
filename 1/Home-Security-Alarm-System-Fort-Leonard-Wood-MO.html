<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
