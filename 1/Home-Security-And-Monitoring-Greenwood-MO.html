<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If using 4G LTE cellular or IP Web, Select either landline or the proper interactive service. Select billing duration: Yearly or month-to-month. We get a 15% prepay discount from our UL central station provider which we pass on to our annual customers.
