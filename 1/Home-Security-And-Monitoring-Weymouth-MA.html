<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, portability and expandability. Tenants, unlike homeowners, usually prevent making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other components can easily be set up at various residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also enable push-button control of the system and general home automation.
