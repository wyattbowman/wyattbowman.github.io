Usually, the bullet CCTV camera type is small, which could be 2.5 to 3 inches long decided by the CCTV camera lens types.

<p>Alarm monitoring becomes part of a complete home security system.

The control panel interacts with the other parts of the system, consisting of the cameras, window and door sensing units, and motion sensing units, to detect an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company right away sets to action, connecting with you and notifying the authorities.</p>
