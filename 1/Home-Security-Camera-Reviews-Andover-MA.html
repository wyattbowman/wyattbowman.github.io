<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
