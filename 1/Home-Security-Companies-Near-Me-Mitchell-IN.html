<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or 2 in location, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range problems.</p>
