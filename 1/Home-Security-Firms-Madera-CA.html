<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet. If a client is having difficulty, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is typically open or usually closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and signals, sensors, gain access to control, and so on.
