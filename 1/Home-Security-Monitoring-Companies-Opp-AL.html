<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with sophisticated smart home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, consisting of creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
