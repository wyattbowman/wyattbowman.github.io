<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
