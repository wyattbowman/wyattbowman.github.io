<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to strive to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines groan, felines squeal, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
