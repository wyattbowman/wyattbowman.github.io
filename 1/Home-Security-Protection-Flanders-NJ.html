<h2>Mobile Video Surveillance Flanders</h2>

Techniques consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and contacting leading researchers to ask about upcoming assessments. Both published and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was international in scope.</p>

(We believe this is a more valuable feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles often pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Web cam.</p>
