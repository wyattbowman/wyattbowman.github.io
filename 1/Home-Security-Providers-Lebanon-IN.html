<p>You'll need to acquire a Nest Aware membership in order to conserve video footage.

Nest Aware memberships are priced per camera, and if you want to pull out of paying for storage completely, Nest just gives you approximately 3 hours worth of recordings.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
