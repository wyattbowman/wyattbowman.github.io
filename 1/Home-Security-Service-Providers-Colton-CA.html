For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the initial cost.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers complimentary benefits like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 each month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked just about half of the time and the camera consistently disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, in addition to when we made changes in the settings.</p>
