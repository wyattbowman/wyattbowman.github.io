<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>A larger security company that constantly monitors your home will have a designated station that watches thousands of homes and services simultaneously.

<p>The second wireless function pertains to how your security system communicates with the alarm monitoring station.
