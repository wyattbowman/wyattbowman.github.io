<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it ought to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
