<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically switch off the heater. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can automatically make the wise lights turn on to scare away potential intruders.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
