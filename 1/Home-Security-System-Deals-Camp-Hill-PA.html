In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
