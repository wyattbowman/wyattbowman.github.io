For the most thorough protection of your property, you want something that consists of night vision and can tape at a good quality - and nearly all cameras now feature at least HD (1080p) resolution. Some, like our existing top security camera suggestion the Arlo Ultra, go up from that to deliver 4K resolution.</p>

We always recommend picking a company known for fantastic customer service. No other security company in Washington State can match Guardian's series of experience in integrated system design.

<h3>Residential Home Security Systems in Texas</h3>
<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and exact same app as the initial Nest Web cam Outdoor, but it includes more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking function (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger install, and a larger operating temperature variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit). It's also more tamper-proof than any of our other picks, however that added security makes for a harder installation procedure, and it costs nearly two times the cost of the Nest Webcam Outdoor.</p>
