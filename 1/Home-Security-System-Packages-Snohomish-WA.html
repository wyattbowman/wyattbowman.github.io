<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several years.

The innovation slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later.
