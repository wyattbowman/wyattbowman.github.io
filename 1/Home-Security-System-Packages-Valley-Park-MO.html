<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger location and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

In this post, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p.
