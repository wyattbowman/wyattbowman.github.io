<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was invented for homeowners. It should be set up by an expert alarm installation group and, once installed, is tough to move from one location to another.

They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to rework the existing wires in your house. If you have actually already set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system, the team will have the ability to reuse the existing wiring.
