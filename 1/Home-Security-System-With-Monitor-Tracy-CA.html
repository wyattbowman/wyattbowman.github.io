<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>You can use a wireless connection to run your SimpliSafe system, but it doesn't support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, indicating you won't have the ability to connect it directly to other third-party devices like smart locks or automate particular actions in the home.
