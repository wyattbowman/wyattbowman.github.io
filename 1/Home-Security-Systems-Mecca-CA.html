<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating innovative smart home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, consisting of clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
