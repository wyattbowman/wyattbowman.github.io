<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to store and how long you plan to keep documented video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not cautious, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
<p>The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its components, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This implied every windows and door needed its own wire and path of holes through your house. Wireless systems utilize radio frequencies that are just reliable approximately a certain radius. You will require a system that has a long reception range and can deal with a more considerable amount of info and signals if you have a big home. Keep in mind: A home larger than 4,500 square feet is typically better off using a wired system.</p>

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic option for long range situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

Both the original House system and the Home Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we checked that also deals with HomeKit.
