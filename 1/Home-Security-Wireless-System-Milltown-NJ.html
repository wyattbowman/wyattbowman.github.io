<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. While alarm system technology has actually established considerably since the 19th century, it is still based upon the basic concepts innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell. All significant alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, use proximity sensing units in the windows and doors as the very first line of defense against prospective burglars, and alarm transfer info to a central monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement quickly and successfully.</p>
