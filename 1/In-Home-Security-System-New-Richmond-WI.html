If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (take a look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that suggests you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax facilities.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides complimentary advantages like person detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked just about half of the time and the camera regularly detached from the network several times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).
