Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers fund authorities action to alarmed properties) a costly and ineffective  method to theft reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
