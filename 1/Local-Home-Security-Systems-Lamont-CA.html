Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to utilize your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

A lot of alarm companies would rather provide and install their own equipment rather than go through this hassle.

We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
