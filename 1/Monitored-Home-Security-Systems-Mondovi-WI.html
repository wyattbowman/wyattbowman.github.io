<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
