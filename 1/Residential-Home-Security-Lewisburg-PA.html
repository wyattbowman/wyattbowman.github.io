Smart alarm changed that. Initially, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, generally a home alarm company. The client paid monthly fees.</p>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning several years.
