However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to collar robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police response to alarmed homes) a pricey and inefficient  method to break-in decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
