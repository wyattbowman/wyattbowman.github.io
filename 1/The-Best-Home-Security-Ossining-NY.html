<p>You can use a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, but it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, suggesting you won't have the ability to link it directly to other third-party devices like smart locks or automate certain actions in the home.

However these combinations aren't quite as robust as the house or Ring systems.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
