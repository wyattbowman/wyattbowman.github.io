<p>The NVR removes these issues, since it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network.
