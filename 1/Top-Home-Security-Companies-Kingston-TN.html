<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Wireless is the way of the future. Some leading home security companies provide professional installation, while others preconfigure your system at the factory and ship to your door for just Do It Yourself setup.

By just purchasing the camera, you already get things like custom activity zones, and TP-Link is reasonably generous with its free cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history). Audio augments video surveillance to better spot and interpret occurrences in real-time. As an added benefit, an audio service can be quickly integrated into the existing security system.
