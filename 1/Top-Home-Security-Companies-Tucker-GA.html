<h3>Cheap Home Security in Georgia</h3>
<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
