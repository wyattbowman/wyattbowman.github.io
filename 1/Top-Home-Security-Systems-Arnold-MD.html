<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If using 4G LTE cellular or IP Internet, Select either landline or the appropriate interactive service. Select billing period: Regular monthly or Yearly. We get a 15% prepay discount from our UL central station provider which we pass on to our annual customers. This is NOT an agreement, rather a yearly prepay discount. When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was reasonably impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being viewed know they're being seen, and you can pick to tape video clips or photos and save them to your wise device on an impulse.</p>
