The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter informs, for instance. However, those functions come at a comparatively high cost: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for 1 month of video history.
