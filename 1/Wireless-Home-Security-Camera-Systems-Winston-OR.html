<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF certified, which indicates you can use a number of various third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera deal with other ONVIF-compliant gadgets.

Another area where Arlo stands out is customer service. After long-term testing this camera because we initially made it a choice in 2016, we observed that our Arlo Q began predicting a pink tint, which seems to be an ongoing problem for some owners.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>

When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch.
