These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to the web and a router.
