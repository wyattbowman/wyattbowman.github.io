<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
