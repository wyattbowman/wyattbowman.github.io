<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a declaration saying the system would signal users when it detected any kind of interference. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be an ideal storm of circumstances for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as conclusive, our company believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not require a new keypad. Using multiple sensing units to monitor activity in one area, software analyses input from all the sources.

A second alarm signal-- received in a nearby zone within a brief time-- is the verification the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
