<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disruption principle based on 2 unshielded (or 'dripping') coax cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter emits constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the change in field strength weakens due to the existence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is generated. The system is hidden after installation. Care should be required to ensure the surrounding soil provides good drainage in order to prevent nuisance alarms.</p>
<p>When it pertains to indoor security equipment, ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all sell pet-friendly motion detectors.
