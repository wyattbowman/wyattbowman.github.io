<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a regular camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with information after the reality, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and use up a great deal of taping storage area. So much, in fact, that they require about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is important.</p>
