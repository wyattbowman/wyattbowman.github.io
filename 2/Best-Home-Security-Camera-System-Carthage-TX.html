Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
