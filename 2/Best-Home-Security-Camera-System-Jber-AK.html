<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and whole communities (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and pricey method to break-in decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
