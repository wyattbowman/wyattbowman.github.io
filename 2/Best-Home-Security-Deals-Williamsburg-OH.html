<p>Geofencing: This feature automates motion detection when you return or leave to a predetermined area (usually your home).

<h3>Digital Security Systems Williamsburg OH 45176</h3>
<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage choice and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is taped. The systems with video storage generally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the gadget itself. This choice is generally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video in the cloud. However, this is generally a paid service and the number of hours it will save will depend upon how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>

<p>Even though 1080p is generally the standard resolution for cameras we've checked, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensing units. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
