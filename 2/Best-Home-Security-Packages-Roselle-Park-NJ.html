<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a expensive and inefficient  approach to robbery decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
