<h3>Wireless Video Security System Talent OR 97540</h3>
<p>Blink cameras are compact, include totally free storage, and use two AA batteries that can last as much as two years. However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.
