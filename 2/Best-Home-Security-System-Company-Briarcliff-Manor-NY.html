<p>Given that the glass real estate does not get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they offset it in abilities. Along with being excellent for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for low-light and infrared given that the glass real estate doesn't impede the lens. With some, it's hard to inform at a look where they've been aimed, so they can give a panoptic impression as a deterrent, no matter their real field of view. Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is a great alternative for a number of various setups.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
