Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
