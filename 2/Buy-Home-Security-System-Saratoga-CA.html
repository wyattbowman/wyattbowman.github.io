<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.
