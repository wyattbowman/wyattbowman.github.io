<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level.
