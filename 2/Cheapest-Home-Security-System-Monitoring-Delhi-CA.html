Furthermore, the shape of the camera is perfect for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but needs several cameras if a user needs to see numerous fixed views.

This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, generally via 110VAC power.</p>
