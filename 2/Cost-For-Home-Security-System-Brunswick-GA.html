<p>On the surface, these 2 camera categories may appear similar, though if you were able to see inside, the distinctions become distinct and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is lots of offered light, and when the lighting becomes absent or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
