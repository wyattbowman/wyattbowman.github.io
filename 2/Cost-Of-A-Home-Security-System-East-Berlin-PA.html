<p>No false alarm penalties: House owners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm. Given that the house owner is in charge of the system, cops are only gotten in touch with if there's a real emergency situation.

If  police are gotten in touch with for an incorrect alarm, property owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for false alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
