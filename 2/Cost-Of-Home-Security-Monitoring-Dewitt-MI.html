<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy DIY installation, other companies offer (and sometimes need) expert installation. Professional installation is readily available for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
