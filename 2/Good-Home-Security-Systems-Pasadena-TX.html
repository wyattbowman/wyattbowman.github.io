Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you walk by.
