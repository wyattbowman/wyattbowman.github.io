<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
