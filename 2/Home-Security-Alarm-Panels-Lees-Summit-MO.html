<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp image approximately 32 feet.

<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was created for house owners. It must be set up by an expert alarm installation team and, when set up, is difficult to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large residential or commercial properties and are typically more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to revamp the existing wires in your home. If you've currently installed a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system, the team will be able to recycle the existing wiring. Nevertheless, if this is your first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>
