<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would alert users when it discovered any type of disturbance.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the problem. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
