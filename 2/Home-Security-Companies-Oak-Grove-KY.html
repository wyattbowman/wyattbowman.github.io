<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Tenants, unlike house owners, typically prevent making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can quickly be established at different homes later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too.
