The majority of homes currently have wireless smoke or fire alarms, however you can link the alarm to your security system to include another layer of protection that might save your life or residential or commercial property.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
