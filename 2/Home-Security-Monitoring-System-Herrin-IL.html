<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can choose whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is triggered. However, you might choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is normally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the client.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, but it doesn't support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, meaning you won't have the ability to connect it straight to other third-party gadgets like smart locks or automate specific actions in the home.
