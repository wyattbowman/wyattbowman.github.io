For several years, Macs were thought to be immune to viruses and were hardly ever targeted by cybercriminals due to the fact that they represented such a small percentage of the individual computing world compared to millions of Windows users.

<p>The security systems I've designed and implemented are strictly for monitoring activity of a prospective target, whether from a terrorist risk or neighborhood burglars or vandals.
