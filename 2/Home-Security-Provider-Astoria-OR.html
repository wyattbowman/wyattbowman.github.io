<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually checked.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video.

<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
