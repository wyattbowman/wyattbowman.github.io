<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System in Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>Flood lights are typically used in combination with motion detectors. When sensors spot movement, the lights light up the surrounding area, which will permit you to see who is on your residential or commercial property and will potentially scare off intruders. Better outdoor lighting likewise implies a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When picking flood lights, think about the brightness and distance the light shines.
