<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
