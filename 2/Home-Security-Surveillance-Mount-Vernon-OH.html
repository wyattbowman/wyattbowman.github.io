<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current.

If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which indicates. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
