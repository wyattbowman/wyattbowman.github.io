<p>Professional installation was almost the only method to put in a home security system 15 years ago. Technology has come such a long way that Do It Yourself systems can offer the very same level of security (and often more) with a self installed system. Further, there can be additional benefits to a Do It Yourself system because they're generally much easier to move to another home if you move. For someone searching for a more complex setup like home automation, or somebody that wants a trained professional to make the recommendation for the setup, expert installation is a terrific alternative.
