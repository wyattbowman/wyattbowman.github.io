<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop.
