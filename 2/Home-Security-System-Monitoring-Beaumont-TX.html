On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will contact cops if a house owner can't verify an incorrect alarm. , if authorities are contacted for an incorrect alarm, homeowners might need to pay a fine for dispatching authorities unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for false alarms and subsequent charges.</p>
