Per the most recent statistics, the typical burglary in the United States lasts for about 90 seconds to 12 minutes and, typically, a burglar will break into a home within one minute. 1 2 Most thefts target money very first followed by drugs, electronic devices, and jewels. 3 Typical security approaches include never hiding extra keys outside, never ever shutting off all the lights, using small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours.</p>
<p>Frame rate: This is another essential element of a camera-- the greater the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is just a series of still images stitched together to create a movie. The lower the frame rate, the less frequently a still is taken; this leads to choppier footage. You'll want to consider the frame rate of the camera you buy before deciding. For reference, "real time" is generally determined as 30 frames per second.

The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers call into question the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or four complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they offer no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
