<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
