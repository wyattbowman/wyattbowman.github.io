Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi details. (You should play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs shout, cats shriek, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>

On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
