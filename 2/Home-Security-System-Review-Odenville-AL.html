While the cameras get most of the attention in the start, you also have other concerns, such as viewing, recording, and archiving the video footage, and the equipment needed for performing those tasks. Here's a look at the basic parts of a common CCTV system. We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. We started with 16 cameras & have grown to 25 cameras. When we needed to include new cameras or troubleshoot problems, Tim in Tech Support has actually been extremely helpful.

<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses assigned to each camera.

Their detectors utilize infrared technology, so its more difficult for a pet dog or feline to trip the sensor. Vivint's sensors are immune to family pets weighing approximately 33 to 55 pounds. Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to family pets weighing as much as 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can tailor the sensitivity level based upon your family pet's size.</p>

Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not come with upfront costs. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts!

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
