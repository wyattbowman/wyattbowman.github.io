<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, scams, and vandalism. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We need to again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive false alarms.
