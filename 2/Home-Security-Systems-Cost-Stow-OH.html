<p>This clever wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we found it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was identified. We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need numerous Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
