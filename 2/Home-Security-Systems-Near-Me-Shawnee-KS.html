<p>It is necessary to understand that the Brinks of yesteryear isn't the very same company as the Brinks of today. The company went through a rebranding and renaming phase in 2009 as Broadview Security due to ownership changes. Nevertheless, MONI Smart Security acquired the name rights for Brinks and brought the initial name back to market in 2018.

<p>Expert installation was almost the only method to put in a home security system 15 years ago. Innovation has actually come such a long way that DIY systems can use the same level of security (and typically more) with a self installed system. Even more, there can be additional benefits to a DIY system because they're generally much easier to move to another home if you move. For someone looking for a more intricate setup like home automation, or someone that desires a trained professional to make the recommendation for the setup, professional installation is a terrific alternative.
