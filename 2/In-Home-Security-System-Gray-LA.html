Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>

Since everything is just stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, getting rid of cameras, detectors, and other components of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new area takes minutes, not days. Wireless systems are the method to go if you lease and move regularly.</p>
