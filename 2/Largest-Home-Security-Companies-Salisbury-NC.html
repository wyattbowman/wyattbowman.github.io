<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and portability. Renters, unlike property owners, usually avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other components can quickly be set up at different properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new elements too. Wireless security plans also enable push-button control of the system and basic home automation.

Although the cameras reviewed in this guide do have basic security functions, they can't replace a complete home security system, that includes door and window and motion sensors, smoke detectors, and so on.</p>
