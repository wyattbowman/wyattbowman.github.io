As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
