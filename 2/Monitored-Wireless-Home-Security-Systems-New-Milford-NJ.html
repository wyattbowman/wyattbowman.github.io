<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cables. DVR systems are hard to scale up due to the fact that once every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to acquire an entirely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the linked cameras be in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>
