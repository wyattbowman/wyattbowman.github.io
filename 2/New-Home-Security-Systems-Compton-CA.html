<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
