The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
