Wireless systems are the way to go if you lease and move frequently.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible transgressors are less likely to devote criminal activity if they think they are being watched or have a higher risk of being apprehended. This is also known as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance technique, which argues that chances to upset can be lowered by changing a range of systems such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from crime commission, and reducing justifications that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the wrongdoer should be aware of the included surveillance for it to accomplish its preferred result.</p>
