<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your family and home. The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what interacts with all of the security sensing units and smart-home parts in your house.

<p>Smoke and smoke alarm notify you if they identify a top-level of smoke or if the temperature rises too quickly, either of which might show a fire. The majority of homes currently have wireless smoke or smoke alarm, but you can connect the alarm to your security system to add another layer of protection that might save your life or home. If the alarm triggers when you're away from home or out of earshot, then any alarms connected to your system will inform you and the security company monitoring your home.

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
