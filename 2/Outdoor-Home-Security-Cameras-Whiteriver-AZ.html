Home security systems are a one-time investment that can settle, big time, down the line. Does the ideal system have all the bells and whistles, from facial recognition to floodlights? Not necessarily. You'll want cameras with solid fundamentals: trustworthy, good image quality, and simple to operate.

After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of approximately one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have observed some enhancements since the camera's launch, and will continue to check and update this review, as required.</p>

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month.
