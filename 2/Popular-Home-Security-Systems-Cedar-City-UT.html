<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent.
