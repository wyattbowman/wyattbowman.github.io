<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers complimentary benefits like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked only about 50 percent of the camera and the time regularly disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, in addition to when we made modifications in the settings.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
