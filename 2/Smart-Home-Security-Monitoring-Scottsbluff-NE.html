The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
