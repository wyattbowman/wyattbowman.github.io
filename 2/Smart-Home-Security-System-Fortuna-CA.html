<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
