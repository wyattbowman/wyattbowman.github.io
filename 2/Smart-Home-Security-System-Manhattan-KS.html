The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
