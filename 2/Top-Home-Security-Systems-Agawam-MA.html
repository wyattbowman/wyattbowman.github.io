<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
