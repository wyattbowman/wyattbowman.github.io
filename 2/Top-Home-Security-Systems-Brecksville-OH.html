<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to keep and how long you prepare to keep recorded video footage. The video footage is going to consume up storage area rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
