<p>The real factor cameras are normally deployed is to reduce much pettier criminal offenses. However it has actually not even been demonstrated that they can do that.

"Once the criminal activity and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the basic downward trend in offenses and criminal activities," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were noted in specific classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had minimized criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
