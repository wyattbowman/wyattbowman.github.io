<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
