<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
